# Issue: Excessive Widget Nesting

## Severity: Medium

## Category: Architecture

## Location
- **File(s)**: `lib/pages/register_device.dart`
- **Line(s)**: 1-182
- **Method/Widget**: `build`

## Description
Widget nesting depth of 12 detected. Deep nesting makes code harder to read and maintain.

## Why This Matters
Deep widget trees are harder to debug, test, and maintain. They can also impact performance.

## Current Code
```dart
// Widget nesting depth: 12
```

## Suggested Fix
Extract nested widgets into separate methods or custom widgets.

## Implementation Steps
1. Identify deeply nested widget sections
2. Extract them into separate methods or custom StatelessWidget classes
3. Pass necessary data as constructor parameters
4. Test to ensure functionality remains the same

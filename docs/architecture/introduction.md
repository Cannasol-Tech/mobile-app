# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Cannasol Technologies Mobile App, built on a **Firebase-centric foundation** that leverages your existing authentication, real-time database, and cloud functions infrastructure. The architecture extends and optimizes your current Firebase implementation to support **Industrial Ultrasonic Liquid Processing Automation Systems** while maintaining the simplicity and reliability you've already established.

This unified approach builds upon your proven Firebase + Flutter foundation, strategically expanding capabilities through additional Firebase services and complementary Google Cloud Platform services, ensuring seamless integration and consistent development patterns for industrial automation monitoring and control.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Firebase-Flutter Brownfield Project** - Building on established foundation:

- **Flutter/Dart mobile application** (primary interface) ✅ Implemented
- **Firebase Authentication** ✅ Implemented  
- **Cloud Firestore** for real-time data ✅ Implemented
- **Firebase Cloud Functions** for backend logic ✅ Implemented
- **Firebase Hosting** for web deployment ✅ Configured
- **Python services** integrated via Cloud Functions/Cloud Run

**Key Architectural Constraints:**
- Maintain Firebase as primary backend platform
- Preserve existing authentication flows and user data
- Extend current Firestore data models
- Build upon existing Cloud Functions patterns
- Leverage Firebase's offline-first mobile capabilities

# Epic 3 Intelligent Alarm Management System

**Epic Goal:** Build comprehensive alarm detection, notification, and management system that delivers immediate push notifications for critical system events, enables rapid operator response through acknowledgment workflows, and maintains detailed alarm history for compliance and analysis purposes.

## Story 3.1 Alarm Detection and Classification

As an industrial operator,
I want the system to automatically detect and classify critical alarms,
so that I can respond appropriately to different types of system events.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Real-time alarm detection for flow, temperature, pressure, overload, and frequency lock events
2. Alarm severity classification (critical, warning, informational) with appropriate prioritization
3. Alarm state management (active, acknowledged, cleared) with proper transitions
4. Duplicate alarm suppression to prevent notification flooding
5. Alarm correlation logic to group related system events
6. Configurable alarm thresholds based on device specifications

## Story 3.2 Push Notification System

As an industrial operator,
I want immediate push notifications for critical alarms,
so that I can respond quickly regardless of my location.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Firebase Cloud Messaging integration for cross-platform push notifications
2. Notification delivery within 30 seconds of alarm trigger
3. Rich notification content with alarm type, device, and severity information
4. Notification sound and vibration patterns differentiated by alarm severity
5. Notification persistence and retry logic for failed deliveries
6. User notification preferences and do-not-disturb scheduling

## Story 3.3 Alarm Acknowledgment and Response

As an industrial operator,
I want to acknowledge alarms and document my response actions,
so that I can track alarm resolution and maintain operational records.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. One-tap alarm acknowledgment from notification or application interface
2. Alarm response documentation with predefined actions and custom notes
3. Acknowledgment timestamp and user identification for audit trail
4. Alarm escalation logic for unacknowledged critical alarms
5. Bulk acknowledgment capabilities for multiple related alarms
6. Response action templates for common alarm scenarios

## Story 3.4 Alarm History and Reporting

As a facility manager,
I want access to 30-day alarm history with filtering and search capabilities,
so that I can analyze alarm patterns and improve system performance.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Comprehensive alarm log with all alarm events and operator responses
2. Filtering by date range, device, alarm type, and severity level
3. Search functionality for specific alarm events or response actions
4. Alarm statistics and trending analysis for pattern identification
5. Export capabilities for compliance reporting and external analysis
6. Data retention management with automatic archiving after 30 days

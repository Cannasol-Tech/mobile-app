# Epic 2 Real-Time Device Monitoring Core

**Epic Goal:** Implement comprehensive device registration and real-time parameter monitoring capabilities that enable operators to view live ultrasonic processing system data across multiple devices simultaneously, delivering immediate operational visibility and forming the foundation for all subsequent monitoring features.

## Story 2.1 Device Registration System

As an industrial operator,
I want to register ultrasonic processing devices using QR codes or manual entry,
so that I can monitor my authorized equipment through the mobile application.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. QR code scanning functionality using device camera with proper permissions
2. Manual device ID entry form with validation and error handling
3. Device registration stored in Firebase with user-specific access control
4. Registration confirmation with device details display
5. Device nickname assignment for easier identification
6. Registration history and device management interface

## Story 2.2 Real-Time Parameter Display

As an industrial operator,
I want to see live flow rates, temperatures, pressures, and frequency status,
so that I can monitor system performance in real-time.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Real-time data synchronization from Firebase Realtime Database with 2-second refresh
2. Parameter display with appropriate units and precision for industrial use
3. Visual indicators for parameter status (normal, warning, critical ranges)
4. Automatic data refresh with manual refresh capability
5. Data validation and error handling for corrupted or missing values
6. Timestamp display for last successful data update

## Story 2.3 Multi-Device Dashboard

As a facility manager,
I want to monitor up to 10 devices simultaneously on a single dashboard,
so that I can oversee multiple processing systems efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Grid layout displaying device cards with key parameters and status
2. Device status indicators (online, offline, alarm, normal) with color coding
3. Quick-switch navigation between devices using swipe gestures
4. Device filtering and sorting capabilities by status or location
5. Responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes and orientations
6. Performance optimization for smooth scrolling with multiple device updates

## Story 2.4 Device Detail View

As an industrial operator,
I want detailed parameter views for individual devices,
so that I can analyze specific system performance and troubleshoot issues.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Comprehensive parameter display with historical trending (last 4 hours)
2. Parameter grouping by system (flow, temperature, pressure, ultrasonic)
3. Expandable sections for detailed parameter information
4. Parameter threshold indicators and normal operating ranges
5. Device information display (model, location, last maintenance)
6. Navigation breadcrumbs and easy return to dashboard

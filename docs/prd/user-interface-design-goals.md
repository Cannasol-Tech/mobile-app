# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

The application prioritizes industrial-grade usability with clear, high-contrast displays optimized for quick parameter assessment and alarm response. The interface emphasizes critical information hierarchy, ensuring operators can instantly identify system status and respond to alarms without cognitive overhead. Design follows industrial HMI principles with large touch targets, minimal navigation depth, and consistent visual patterns that work effectively in various lighting conditions and while wearing industrial PPE.

## Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Dashboard-First Navigation:** Primary interface centers on real-time device monitoring dashboard with minimal navigation required for core functions
- **Gesture-Based Device Switching:** Swipe gestures enable rapid switching between monitored devices without menu navigation
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Critical alarms and status information displayed prominently, with detailed parameters accessible through single-tap expansion
- **Contextual Actions:** Device-specific controls and configuration options appear contextually based on current device selection and user permissions

## Core Screens and Views

- **Multi-Device Dashboard:** Primary monitoring interface showing all registered devices with status indicators and key parameters
- **Device Detail View:** Comprehensive parameter display for individual ultrasonic processing systems
- **Alarm Management Screen:** Active and historical alarm display with acknowledgment and clearing workflows
- **Device Registration Interface:** QR code scanning and manual device ID entry workflows
- **Configuration Control Panel:** Remote parameter adjustment interface with safety confirmations
- **User Profile and Settings:** Account management, notification preferences, and device access control

## Accessibility: WCAG AA

Industrial environments require reliable accessibility compliance for operators with varying visual capabilities and those wearing protective equipment. WCAG AA compliance ensures adequate color contrast ratios, scalable text, and alternative interaction methods.

## Branding

Clean, professional industrial aesthetic with high-contrast color schemes optimized for industrial environments. Primary brand colors should maintain visibility under various lighting conditions including fluorescent, LED, and outdoor lighting. Interface elements sized appropriately for use with industrial gloves and in vibration-prone environments.  Using Cannasol Technologies colors like the blue and green in the logo.  Stick with the previously implemented user interface design and layout as much as possible when implementing new features.

## Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

Web Responsive design with native iOS and Android applications. Full feature parity across platforms with responsive web interface optimized for desktop monitoring stations and mobile devices. Interface adapts to screen sizes from 5-inch mobile displays to 24-inch industrial monitoring screens.

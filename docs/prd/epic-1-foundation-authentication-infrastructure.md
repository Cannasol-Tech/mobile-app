# Epic 1 Foundation & Authentication Infrastructure

**Epic Goal:** Establish robust project foundation with Firebase integration, secure user authentication, and deployable application shell that includes basic health monitoring capabilities, providing immediate value through system connectivity validation while setting up all core infrastructure for subsequent development phases.

## Story 1.1 Project Setup and Development Environment

As a developer,
I want a properly configured Flutter project with Firebase integration,
so that I can build cross-platform applications with cloud backend capabilities.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Flutter 3.29+ project created with iOS, Android, and web platform support
2. Firebase project configured with Realtime Database, Authentication, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Messaging
3. Development environment includes proper linting, formatting, and debugging configurations
4. Git repository established with appropriate .gitignore and branch protection rules
5. CI/CD pipeline configured for automated testing and deployment
6. Project structure follows monorepo pattern with platform-specific directories

## Story 1.2 Firebase Authentication Integration

As an industrial operator,
I want to securely log into the monitoring application using my Google account,
so that I can access my authorized devices with enterprise-grade security.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Firebase Authentication integrated with Google Sign-In provider
2. User session management with automatic token refresh
3. Secure logout functionality that clears all local authentication data
4. Error handling for authentication failures with user-friendly messages
5. Authentication state persistence across application restarts
6. Basic user profile display showing authenticated user information

## Story 1.3 Application Shell and Navigation

As an industrial operator,
I want a consistent navigation structure across all platforms,
so that I can efficiently access monitoring features regardless of my device.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Bottom navigation bar for mobile platforms with primary feature access
2. Responsive navigation drawer for web platform with collapsible sidebar
3. Consistent branding and industrial-appropriate color scheme across platforms
4. Loading states and error boundaries for robust user experience
5. Platform-specific UI adaptations while maintaining feature parity
6. Accessibility compliance with WCAG AA standards for navigation elements

## Story 1.4 Health Check and Connectivity Monitoring

As a facility manager,
I want to verify that the application can connect to Firebase services,
so that I can confirm system readiness before deploying to production.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Health check endpoint that validates Firebase Realtime Database connectivity
2. Network connectivity status indicator visible in application header
3. Automatic retry logic for failed connectivity attempts with exponential backoff
4. Offline mode detection with appropriate user notifications
5. Firebase service status monitoring with error reporting
6. Basic logging framework integrated for debugging and monitoring

# Epic 4 Remote Configuration & Control

**Epic Goal:** Enable secure remote parameter adjustment and operational control capabilities that allow authorized operators to modify processing parameters, start/stop systems, and manage device configurations from any location while maintaining industrial safety standards and audit compliance.

## Story 4.1 Parameter Adjustment Interface

As an industrial operator,
I want to remotely adjust temperature setpoints, flow rates, and timing parameters,
so that I can optimize system performance without on-site visits.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Secure parameter adjustment interface with current and target value display
2. Parameter validation against safe operating ranges with confirmation dialogs
3. Real-time parameter update with immediate feedback and verification
4. Parameter change logging with user identification and timestamp
5. Rollback capability for recent parameter changes
6. Parameter adjustment permissions based on user role and device authorization

## Story 4.2 System Control Operations

As an industrial operator,
I want to start and stop ultrasonic processing systems remotely,
so that I can manage operations efficiently and respond to changing conditions.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Remote start/stop controls with safety interlocks and confirmation requirements
2. System status verification before allowing control operations
3. Control operation logging with detailed audit trail
4. Emergency stop functionality with immediate system shutdown capability
5. Control operation feedback with success/failure confirmation
6. Operational safety checks and prerequisite validation

## Story 4.3 Configuration Management

As a facility manager,
I want to manage device configurations and user access permissions,
so that I can maintain security and operational consistency across systems.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Device configuration backup and restore capabilities
2. User access control management with role-based permissions
3. Configuration change approval workflow for critical parameters
4. Configuration versioning and change history tracking
5. Bulk configuration updates for multiple similar devices
6. Configuration validation and conflict resolution

## Story 4.4 Safety and Compliance Features

As a facility manager,
I want comprehensive safety controls and compliance logging,
so that I can ensure safe operations and meet regulatory requirements.

**Acceptance Criteria**

1. Safety interlock verification before allowing remote operations
2. Comprehensive audit logging for all control actions and configuration changes
3. User authentication verification for critical operations
4. Operation timeout and automatic safety shutdown capabilities
5. Compliance reporting with detailed operation and change logs
6. Emergency contact and escalation procedures for safety events

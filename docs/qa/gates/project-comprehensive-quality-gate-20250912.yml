# Quality Gate Decision Rationale
gate_rationale: |
  CONCERNS gate assigned due to multiple critical quality issues that must be addressed:
  
  1. CRITICAL: Test coverage at 10.3% vs required 85% - massive gap
  2. HIGH: Test compilation failures preventing proper quality assessment
  3. HIGH: Firebase initialization issues causing widespread test failures
  4. MEDIUM: Widget test infrastructure problems affecting UI validation
  5. MEDIUM: Provider lifecycle issues indicating architectural concerns
  
  While the project shows good architectural foundation and comprehensive documentation,
  the testing infrastructure requires immediate attention to meet company standards.
  
  The project is NOT production-ready in its current testing state and requires
  significant investment in test infrastructure and coverage before release.

# Recommendations
recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Halt any production deployment plans until testing issues resolved"
    - "Assign dedicated resources to fix test compilation failures"
    - "Implement comprehensive Firebase test mocking strategy"
    - "Create proper test asset management"
    
  short_term:
    - "Achieve minimum 50% test coverage within 2 weeks"
    - "Implement all required make targets"
    - "Fix widget test infrastructure completely"
    - "Establish proper CI/CD quality gates"
    
  long_term:
    - "Achieve 85% test coverage following Flutter Testing Standard"
    - "Implement comprehensive integration test suite"
    - "Establish golden test framework for UI consistency"
    - "Create automated quality monitoring"

# Next Steps
next_steps:
  - "Development team to prioritize test infrastructure fixes"
  - "QA to provide ongoing support for test implementation"
  - "Re-assess project quality gate after critical issues resolved"
  - "Implement continuous quality monitoring"

# Compliance Status
compliance_status:
  flutter_testing_standard: "NON_COMPLIANT"
  company_testing_sop: "NON_COMPLIANT"
  bmad_core_workflows: "PARTIAL"
  production_readiness: "NOT_READY"

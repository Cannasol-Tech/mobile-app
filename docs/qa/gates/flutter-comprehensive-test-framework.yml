  Comprehensive test design framework established following Flutter Testing Standard v1.1.0.
  Framework provides clear guidance for:
  - Test level selection (unit/widget/integration/golden)
  - Priority classification (P0-P3)
  - Coverage requirements (85%/70%/80%)
  - Mocking policies (Mocktail for dependencies only)
  - Test organization structure (70/20/10 pyramid)
  - Quality gates and validation criteria
  
  Framework is ready for application to specific stories using *review command.

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - Apply framework to existing stories using *review {story} command
    - Implement make targets in project Makefile
    - Set up test directory structure as specified
    - Configure CI/CD pipeline for coverage enforcement
    
  ongoing:
    - Monitor test execution performance
    - Track coverage trends and failure patterns
    - Update golden files regularly
    - Maintain centralized mock definitions
    
  quality_improvements:
    - Establish test data management strategy
    - Implement automated test generation for models
    - Create reusable test utilities for common patterns
    - Set up visual regression testing pipeline

compliance_checklist:
  - ✅ Flutter Testing Standard v1.1.0 compliance
  - ✅ Company-wide testing SOP alignment
  - ✅ Mocktail exclusive mocking framework
  - ✅ Coverage requirements defined
  - ✅ Test pyramid distribution specified
  - ✅ Cross-platform considerations included
  - ✅ Quality gates established
  - ✅ Make targets standardized

next_steps:
  - Use *review {story} for specific story test design
  - Use *trace {story} for requirements mapping
  - Use *gate {story} for individual story quality gates
  - Apply framework to prioritize testing efforts

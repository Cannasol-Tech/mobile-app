# Comprehensive Test Design Framework: Flutter Mobile App

Date: 2025-09-12
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)
Project: Cannasol Technologies Mobile Application
Framework: Flutter Cross-Platform Application

## Test Strategy Overview

This document provides a comprehensive test design framework following the official Flutter Testing Standard (v1.1.0) and company-wide testing standards for the Cannasol Technologies Mobile Application.

### Framework Compliance

- **Primary Framework**: `flutter_test` (Flutter SDK)
- **Mocking Framework**: `mocktail` ^1.0.4 (OFFICIAL STANDARD)
- **Coverage Requirements**: Unit ≥85%, Widget ≥70%, Overall ≥80%
- **Testing Pyramid**: 70% Unit, 20% Widget, 10% Integration

### Test Distribution Strategy

| Test Type | Percentage | Coverage Requirement | Mocking Policy |
|-----------|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Unit Tests | 70% | ≥85% statement coverage | Mocktail permitted for external dependencies |
| Widget Tests | 20% | ≥70% widget coverage | Dependency mocking only (no widget/rendering mocks) |
| Integration Tests | 10% | Critical paths | NO mocking permitted |
| Golden Tests | As needed | Visual regression | NO mocking permitted |

## Test Level Framework Application

### Unit Tests (70% of test suite)

**When to use:**
- Business logic validation
- Data model operations
- Service layer functionality
- Utility functions and calculations
- Handler classes and state management

**Flutter-Specific Examples:**
```yaml
unit_test_scenarios:
  - component: 'AuthenticationHandler'
    scenario: 'Validate user credentials with multiple authentication methods'
    justification: 'Complex business logic with multiple branches'
    mock_requirements: 'Mock FirebaseAuth, platform channels'
    
  - component: 'DeviceDataProcessor'
    scenario: 'Process ultrasonic sensor data with error handling'
    justification: 'Critical data transformation logic'
    mock_requirements: 'Mock data repositories, network services'
    
  - component: 'AlarmCalculator'
    scenario: 'Calculate alarm thresholds based on device configuration'
    justification: 'Complex calculation logic with edge cases'
    mock_requirements: 'Mock configuration service'
```

### Widget Tests (20% of test suite)

**When to use:**
- UI component behavior
- User interaction validation
- Widget state management
- Navigation flows
- Form validation

**Flutter-Specific Examples:**
```yaml
widget_test_scenarios:
  - component: 'DeviceMonitoringCard'
    scenario: 'Display real-time device status with alarm indicators'
    justification: 'Critical UI component for monitoring workflow'
    mock_requirements: 'Mock device data stream, alarm service'
    
  - component: 'LoginForm'
    scenario: 'User authentication with validation feedback'
    justification: 'Core user journey entry point'
    mock_requirements: 'Mock authentication service'
    
  - component: 'ConfigurationPanel'
    scenario: 'Remote device configuration with real-time updates'
    justification: 'Complex form with dynamic validation'
    mock_requirements: 'Mock configuration API, device connection'
```

### Integration Tests (10% of test suite)

**When to use:**
- Critical user journeys
- Cross-platform functionality
- End-to-end workflows
- Platform-specific features

**Flutter-Specific Examples:**
```yaml
integration_test_scenarios:
  - journey: 'Complete Device Monitoring Workflow'
    scenario: 'User logs in, monitors devices, responds to alarms'
    justification: 'Revenue-critical path for industrial automation'
    environment: 'Full app with test backend'
    
  - journey: 'Remote Configuration Management'
    scenario: 'User configures device settings remotely'
    justification: 'Core value proposition of the application'
    environment: 'Cross-platform validation required'
```

### Golden Tests (Visual Regression)

**When to use:**
- UI consistency validation
- Cross-platform visual parity
- Design system compliance
- Responsive layout verification

## Priority Classification Framework

### P0 - Critical (Must Test)
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Real-time device monitoring
- Alarm management system
- Data integrity operations
- Cross-platform compatibility

### P1 - High (Should Test)
- Device configuration workflows
- User interface responsiveness
- Navigation and routing
- Data synchronization
- Offline functionality

### P2 - Medium (Nice to Test)
- Advanced settings and preferences
- Reporting and analytics
- Help and documentation
- Theme customization

### P3 - Low (Test if Time Permits)
- Debug utilities
- Advanced preferences
- Experimental features

## Make Targets Implementation

### Required Make Targets
```bash
# Unit Testing (mocking allowed)
make test-unit
# - Executes: flutter test test/unit/
# - Coverage: ≥85% requirement
# - Mocking: Mocktail permitted

# Widget Testing (dependency mocking allowed)
make test-widget
# - Executes: flutter test test/widget/
# - Coverage: ≥70% requirement
# - Mocking: External dependencies only

# Golden Testing (visual regression)
make test-golden
# - Executes: flutter test test/golden/
# - Mocking: PROHIBITED

# Integration Testing (end-to-end)
make test-integration
# - Executes: flutter test integration_test/
# - Mocking: PROHIBITED

# Complete Test Suite
make test
# - Executes all test types in sequence
```

## Mocktail Best Practices

### Permitted Mocking (Unit & Widget Tests)
```dart
// ✅ Correct: Mock external dependencies
class MockFirebaseAuth extends Mock implements FirebaseAuth {}
class MockDeviceRepository extends Mock implements DeviceRepository {}
class MockAlarmService extends Mock implements AlarmService {}

// Fallback value registration
void main() {
  setUpAll(() {
    registerFallbackValue(MockAuthCredential());
    registerFallbackValue(MockDeviceData());
  });
}
```

### Prohibited Mocking
```dart
// ❌ NEVER mock Flutter widgets or rendering
// ❌ NEVER mock in integration tests
// ❌ NEVER mock in golden tests
// ❌ NEVER use Mockito (use Mocktail exclusively)
```

## Quality Gates

Before story completion, verify:
- [ ] Unit tests achieve ≥85% coverage
- [ ] Widget tests achieve ≥70% coverage
- [ ] Overall project coverage ≥80%
- [ ] All P0 scenarios have comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Integration tests cover critical user journeys
- [ ] Golden tests validate UI consistency
- [ ] All tests pass in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] No prohibited mocking patterns used

## Cross-Platform Considerations

- Android-specific functionality validation
- iOS-specific functionality validation
- Web platform compatibility
- Responsive design across screen sizes

### Test Environment Requirements
- Emulator/simulator testing
- Physical device validation
- Network condition simulation
- Offline functionality testing

## Continuous Quality Improvement

### Test Maintenance
- Regular golden file updates
- Test data refresh cycles
- Mock service updates
- Performance test validation

### Metrics Tracking
- Test execution time monitoring
- Coverage trend analysis
- Failure pattern identification
- Test reliability metrics

## Implementation Guidance

This framework should be applied to each story by:
1. Analyzing acceptance criteria for testable scenarios
2. Applying the test level framework to determine appropriate test types
3. Assigning priorities based on business risk
4. Creating test scenarios following Flutter testing standards
5. Implementing tests using approved frameworks and patterns
6. Validating coverage requirements before story completion

For specific story implementation, use the `*review {story}` command to generate detailed test scenarios following this framework.

# Cannasol Technologies Mobile Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

• Enable 25% reduction in unplanned downtime through real-time remote monitoring and immediate alarm response
• Achieve 40% reduction in required on-site monitoring time while maintaining system performance standards  
• Deliver sub-5-minute alarm response times (target: 2 minutes) through mobile push notifications
• Support monitoring of up to 10 concurrent ultrasonic processing devices per user account
• Establish scalable foundation for 50+ concurrent client installations within 18 months
• Generate measurable ROI through reduced operational costs and improved equipment effectiveness
• Provide 99.5% system availability for real-time data synchronization and critical notifications

### Background Context

Industrial ultrasonic liquid processing systems currently require constant on-site presence for monitoring critical parameters like flow rates, temperatures, pressures, and frequency lock status. This creates significant operational inefficiencies, with production losses potentially exceeding $10,000 per hour when system failures go undetected. The Cannasol Technologies Mobile Application addresses this challenge by providing comprehensive remote monitoring capabilities through a Firebase-powered cloud platform.

The solution leverages Flutter's cross-platform capabilities to deliver native performance across iOS, Android, and web platforms, specifically designed for industrial operators and facility managers who need reliable remote access to their ultrasonic processing equipment. Unlike generic IoT platforms, this application is purpose-built for ultrasonic liquid processing with specialized monitoring displays and intelligent alarm management systems that ensure immediate response to critical system events.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

The application prioritizes industrial-grade usability with clear, high-contrast displays optimized for quick parameter assessment and alarm response. The interface emphasizes critical information hierarchy, ensuring operators can instantly identify system status and respond to alarms without cognitive overhead. Design follows industrial HMI principles with large touch targets, minimal navigation depth, and consistent visual patterns that work effectively in various lighting conditions and while wearing industrial PPE.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

- **Dashboard-First Navigation:** Primary interface centers on real-time device monitoring dashboard with minimal navigation required for core functions
- **Gesture-Based Device Switching:** Swipe gestures enable rapid switching between monitored devices without menu navigation
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Critical alarms and status information displayed prominently, with detailed parameters accessible through single-tap expansion
- **Contextual Actions:** Device-specific controls and configuration options appear contextually based on current device selection and user permissions

### Core Screens and Views

- **Multi-Device Dashboard:** Primary monitoring interface showing all registered devices with status indicators and key parameters

### Accessibility: WCAG AA

Industrial environments require reliable accessibility compliance for operators with varying visual capabilities and those wearing protective equipment. WCAG AA compliance ensures adequate color contrast ratios, scalable text, and alternative interaction methods.

### Branding

Clean, professional industrial aesthetic with high-contrast color schemes optimized for industrial environments. Primary brand colors should maintain visibility under various lighting conditions including fluorescent, LED, and outdoor lighting. Interface elements sized appropriately for use with industrial gloves and in vibration-prone environments.

### Target Device and Platforms: Cross-Platform

Web Responsive design with native iOS and Android applications. Full feature parity across platforms with responsive web interface optimized for desktop monitoring stations and mobile devices. Interface adapts to screen sizes from 5-inch mobile displays to 24-inch industrial monitoring screens.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo

Single repository containing the Flutter application codebase with platform-specific configurations in dedicated directories. This approach aligns with your Project Brief's preference for shared Flutter codebase while maintaining organized separation of iOS, Android, and web platform configurations.

### Service Architecture

**Firebase-Centered Microservices Architecture:** The system utilizes Firebase Cloud Functions as microservices for alarm processing, data aggregation, and notification delivery.

# Cannasol Technologies Mobile App - Testing Makefile
# 
# This Makefile provides standardized testing targets per company Flutter Testing Standard
# All targets follow the testing pyramid distribution: 70% unit, 20% widget, 10% integration
#
# Usage:
#   make test           - Run complete test suite
#   make test-unit      - Run unit tests only (≥85% coverage)
#   make test-widget    - Run widget tests only (≥70% coverage)
#   make test-golden    - Run golden tests (visual regression)
#   make test-integration - Run integration tests
#   make coverage       - Generate coverage report
#   make clean-test     - Clean test artifacts
